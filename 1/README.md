# GEB Problem #1

To run these examples from this directory:

```bash
make ruby
```

```bash
make haskell
```

```bash
make python
```

By default, only the first 100 theorems are displayed. To run until your system crashes, invoke the haskell or ruby programs directly.


## setup

You may not have haskell installed. On my mac, installing it was as simple as

```bash
brew install ghc
```
